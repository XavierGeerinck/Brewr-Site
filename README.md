# Introduction
Brewr was designed as a tool to automatically manage your development environment. The vision was that a company would be able to sign-up and generate their "local development environments" through an easy to use GUI editor. Once that was done companies could then add developers to the project so that they could download and use the environment on their computer through the push of a button.

Once updates were available for a certain image, the app should then download them and automatically install them without any downtime on the developer his/her pc.

# Why it was halted
The project was halted because of the lack of time, the idea together with the dashboard was developed and coded by [Xavier Geerinck (@XavierGeerinck)](https://twitter.com/XavierGeerinck), most of the design work was done by [Jesper Lindstr√∂m](https://twitter.com/jesperlindstrom). After a few months my brother came along to help [Maxim Geerinck](https://twitter.com/c4d3r).

I am sad to disband this project because I think it still has a lot of potential, but I hope that someone else willl pick it up and eventually transform it in a startup. I however do hope that once this happens I will get to see credits towards me for the initial idea.
